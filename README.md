# BitwardenBackup

This repo contains a script for backing up a Bitwarden vault and encrypting it for storage locally. It is an expansion of [this article](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli-auth-challenges/) on how to do scripted backups but it uses the users Bitwarden API Key so users with 2FA can have an automated backup.

## Key Takeaways
- Backups are encrypted
- A local copy can be kept safely

Usage documentation can be [found here](https://binarypatrick.dev/posts/bitwarden-automated-backup/).
